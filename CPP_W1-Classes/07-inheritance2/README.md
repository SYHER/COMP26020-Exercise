The program [inheritance2.cpp](inheritance2.cpp) declares two classes with an
inheritance relationship. It fails to compile due to a coding mistake. Fix the
mistake to have the compiled code produce the following output:
```shell
./inheritance2
derived method called, z: 5. Now calling base_method
base_method called, x: 3, y: 4
```

Check the correctness of your program with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log ppetoumenos/comp26020-problems/2023-2024/CPP_W1-Classes/07-inheritance2
```
